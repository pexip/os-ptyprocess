Description: Run a subprocess in a pseudo terminal from Python 3
 Launch a subprocess in a pseudo terminal (pty), and interact with both
 the process and its pty.
 .
 Sometimes, piping stdin and stdout is not enough. There might be a password
 prompt that doesn't read from stdin, output that changes when it's going to
 a pipe rather than a terminal, or curses-style interfaces that rely on a
 terminal. If you need to automate these things, running the process in a
 pseudo terminal (pty) is the answer.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
